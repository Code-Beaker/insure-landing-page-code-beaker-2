## What I learned

I got to explore a new world of layouts by building this amazing projects. I was able to use:

- `grid` layout and make it repsonsive.
- use `flex` to create and manage simple and complex layouts
- Build accessible links and buttons
- Match the website to the design as close as possible.

It took about a week because I was busy with my school but I finally completed it on 19/06/2024.

I got to use SCSS to write better and easier CSS. I'm proud of completing it without the help of google or stackoverflow.
